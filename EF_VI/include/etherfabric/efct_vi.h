**  \brief Extended \a ef_vi API for EFCT architectures
**
** EFCT architectures have significant differences from other architectures,
** affecting how the \a ef_vi abstraction can be used. In particular, the
** application is not responsible for buffer allocation.
**
** The transmit path is by CTPIO only, so there are no DMA buffers. Transmission
** can be performed using \a ef_vi functions, with some caveats:
**  \li \a base address arguments must be obtained from registered memory
**    regions via \a ef_memreg_dma_addr, as for the DMA buffers used by other
**    architectures.
**  \li Protocol headers must contain valid checksums: this architecture does
**    not support transmit checksum offload.
**  \li Transmission can fail (returning -EAGAIN) if there is not enough space
**    in the adapter's FIFO to write the packet data. This differs from other
**    architectures, which limit the number of packet buffers which can be
**    enqueued. You can use \a ef_vi_transmit_space_bytes to check the available
**    space.
**  \li PIO functions (e.g. \a ef_vi_transmit_pio) are not supported.
**  \li Most functions perform store-and-forward: all data is written to the
**    adapter's FIFO before transmission begins.
**  \li \a ef_vi_transmit_ctpio allows cut-through mode, with \a ct_threshold
**    specifying how many bytes to write before transmission begins. This
**    allows transmission from arbitrary user memory.
**  \li \a ef_vi_transmit_ctpio should be followed up with
**    \a ef_vi_transmit_ctpio_fallback, providing packet data in registered
**    memory, to check for failure, retry if needed, and assign a \a dma_id.
**    This step can be omitted, in which case failure due to insufficient space
**    will not be reported, and completion will report an arbitrary non-zero
**    \a dma_id.
**
** The receive path uses buffers managed by the kernel, which might be shared
** with other processes. An alternative API is provided to access and manage
** these buffers. On completion of a received packet, an event of type RX_REF
** or RX_REF_DISCARD transfers ownership of the buffer to the application, via
** a \a pkt_id identifier. This identifier can be used to access packet data.
**
** The packet buffer must be released after use; after release, the identifier
** and any pointers to packet data must be considered invalid. The buffer should
** be released promptly, as it is managed as part of a larger shared buffer.
** Retaining a reference will prevent reuse of the entire buffer and may cause
** the system to run out of buffers and drop incoming packets. If the packet
** data needs to be retained after handling the completion event, then copy it
** to a user buffer before releasing the packet buffer.
